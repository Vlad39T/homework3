<h2>Mathematical formulas</h2>

<p><i>Linear Equations</i><br>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form<br><br>
<div ><span class="one">ax + b = 0</span></div></p>
<p>where a and b are real numbers and x is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation.<br>
    Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form.<br>
    Also, the variable may or may not be an x so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an x there.</p>
